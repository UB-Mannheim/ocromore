Dear Mr. & Mrs. Rice :


On behalf of the President and Board of Governors of Wayne State University,
thank you for your recent gift.

Your ongoing support of Wayne State makes a difference! With your help, we can
provide our University with the funds that insure the margin of excellence.
Pre-eminence can only be achieved through active support and determination of
dedicated alumni, faculty, parents, students and friends of WSU.

Investing in higher education is one of the best possible ways for individuals
and organizations to contribute to society.  We are preparing men and women for
the needs of today and the challenges of tomorrow.  Our students, graduates and
faculty are working to make this a better world.  Their interests touch all
areas, from the management of rapidly advancing technologies in engineering,
medicine and business to the enhancement of life through the social sciences
and humanities.

Through your fiscal 1986-87 gift, you participate actively in the advancement
of our students and our University.  Thank you, again, for your commitment to
Wayne State.


                      Sincerely,


                      Judith E. Nichols
                      Executive Director
