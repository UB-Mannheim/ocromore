Re:     MODSIM II with SIMGRAPHICS II, and the new graphical browser
        OBJECT.MGR


        CACI has always recognized the benefit of having its state-of-the-art systems used
by universities for research and teaching.  It is our experience that students demand the
tools that they know will solve their analysis problems when they go into industry.

        For that reason we are now offering faculty members a complete teaching package
with support for only a low distribution fee.

        In addition to MODSIM II, we provide training, support, complete documentation,
and sample problems -- everything you need to conveniently incorporate the new object-
oriented technology into your teaching and research.

        More than 3,750 university faculty members have already taken us up on our offer
of MODSIM II or other products.  They have found that the ease of use and automatic
error checking built into our systems greatly simplify the teaching of object-oriented and
graphics concepts.  In addition, because MODSIM II can handle complex problems, they
often select it for graduate studies and research.

MODSIM II with SIMGRAPHICS

        MODSIM II is a high-level object-oriented language with built-in graphics.

        As an object-oriented programming language, MODSIM II is at a higher level
than C++, just as FORTRAN is at a higher level than assembly language.  MODSIM II
supports multiple inheritance and dynamic object creation.  Objects may redefine
methods, and communicate through message passing.  The compiler is itself written in
MODSIM II.

        If your interest is simulation, MODSIM II has all the constructs you need.

        SIMGRAPHICS lets your students define input forms, graphs and icons for
animation with no programming.  This makes their results easy-to-understand.
