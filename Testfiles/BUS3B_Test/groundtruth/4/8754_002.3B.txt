Using Allegro CL\PC, your productivity can improve dramatically. Unlike C++, the tools you
need are already built in. And you don't have to finish a program before it can be executed.
Which makes it easier to define and modify program components and immediately debug
them. So you can build intelligent applications in less time.

Allegro CL\PC's unique features include:

~ An integrated development environment. The system comes complete with a
  programmable editor, inspector, debugger, tracer, structure editor, time-profiler, stepper and
  garbage collector-~all designed to give you greater flexibility, reduce errors and speed up
  your work.

~ A Dynamic Link Library (DLL) interface to code written in other languages, such as C and
  FORTRAN.

~ A runtime generator for creating royalty-free stand-alone applications.

~ A 32-bit native compiler to make your applications run faster.

~ Common Graphics, an object-oriented layer on top of the Microsoft Windows API, for fast
  design of standard GUIs.

Don't be surprised if you find just about everything on your wish list in Allegro CL\PC. It was designed by
developers for developers. We know what you want, because we want it, too.
