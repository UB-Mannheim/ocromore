Enclosed you will find the most recent issue of Electronic News and the Distribution Trends
yearly supplement. This publication has tracked and reported the trends and changes in the
electronic distribution industry for many years and has a unique perspective on the industry.

As our industry evolves, changes affect our daily lives. Mergers, acquisitions, product line

excel in supporting customers' technical, specific service and value-added needs.

Bell Microproducts is a specialist distributor of high technology semiconductors and computer
products, and in addition, is one of the few distribution companies to offer complete contract
manufacturing of circuit boards, including in-house assembly and test. The industry's most
comprehensive value-added programs ideally position Bell Microproducts to support our
customers. The Bell Microproducts' team is committed to being your best supplier of high
tech semiconductors, computer products and value-added needs.

Your support of Bell Microproducts is appreciated and has contributed to the rapid growth
