Dear Friend,


Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis, Inc. (TADC) is a non-
profit agency operating in Las Vegas since 1977, offering shelter,
counseling and other services for families experiencing domestic
violence.

Each year, TADC sponsors a luncheon during National Domestic
Violence Awareness Month. On October 13th, at the Rio Suite
Hotel, the Tenth Annual Luncheon will feature a Silent Auction,
with items donated by local hotels and businesses. The auction
will help defray costs for the community-awareness programs
conducted during the month. Proceeds realized go directly into
services for victims of domestic violence.

If you would like to assist TADC in this effort, we would
appreciate the donation of gift certificates, show tickets, or any
items appropriate for an auction.

Enclosed is TADC's brochure, which describes the services
offered, and a copy of the luncheon invitation. Please call Linda
at 368-1533 to arrange for your donation to be included in our
Silent Auction. Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,


Estelle Murphy
Executive Director
