Dear Professor,


     As software engineering moves the world of computing towards a more
disciplined approach to software development, the Ada programming language
is gaining widespread acceptance.  Its capabilities for encapsulation, data
abstraction, and portability make Ada an important contributor to the emerging
software culture.

     With the growing importance of this culture, there can be no better time to
announce that the third edition of Software Engineering with Ada is now
available.  Written by Grady Booch and his new coauthor Doug Bryan, the best-
selling text provides a comprehensive look at this powerful language.

     The third edition reflects not only Grady Booch's expertise in complex
software systems and object-oriented development but also Doug Bryan's
experience teaching software engineering at Stanford University and his research
into Ada programming environments.  The new edition also features
comprehensive, up-to-date coverage and expanded pedagogy, including five
new large-scale programming examples that implement object-oriented methods.

     Enclosed is a detailed brochure on the third edition.  Once you've had the
opportunity to review it, I think you'll share my enthusiasm for this classic text
on maximizing the potential of Ada.  You'll also find a brochure on our other 
computer science and engineering titles enclosed.  For more information, please
complete and mail the enclosed reply card or call 800/552-2499.


Sincerely,


Dan Joraanstad
Executive Editor
