in our Armed Services for their dedication to duty and country in the Persian Gulf
conflict.  As mandated, the proceeds after costs will be applied to a fund that will in
the future provide a silver version of the medal to all Persian Gulf veterans.

	I hope you enjoy your 1993 American Proof Eagles and Persian Gulf
Veterans National Medal, and I thank you for your continued interest in this
fascinating hobby.


Sincerely,


David J. Ryder
