INSURANCE GROUP


Dear Pet Owner:


I am pleased to send the enclosed information you requested for your pet's major-medical 
insurance coverage.

VPI, the only successful Pet Health Insurance Company in America was organized in
1980.  Its purpose was, and is, to help improve the quality of pets' lives and to be of
financial assistance to pet owners with certain veterinary bills.

Testimonial to customer satisfaction is proven by the program's exceptionally high
renewal rate.

Pets experience most all of the same medical problems as people do along with a host of
others.  Pet illnesses that use to spell certain death can now be treated but, like human
medicine, its costly.  Veterinarians are treating liver, kidney, heart and lung conditions as

what VPI is all about!
