Re: Guardianship Duties


Dear Sheila:


As requested by you, enclosed please find a general list of
the guardianship duties prepared by my office. The list was
compiled from the Nevada Statutes (N.R.S. Chapter 159)
currently in effect concerning guardianships (both estate and
person). I must caution you that the list is in general
language and if you have a specific question, or questions,
regarding a particular guardianship matter, please consult
with an attorney.

I look forward to seeing you and speaking before SALT on
April 21, 1992, regarding Trusts.


Very truly yours,


Patricia F. McAllister, Esq.
