choose to upgrade to Visual C++ Standard Edition for only $79*-~that's less than half the suggested retail
price of $199. (Please refer to the table included in the data sheet for specific differences between these
two versions.)

I guess you can tell I'm pretty jazzed about this technology.  We're very proud of Visual C++ and I think
you'll get great results with it and have fun, too.  It may well be the best C/C++ product ever created!  We
managed to hold the line on upgrade prices, too, because we have appreciated your business, and we don't
want you to miss out on Visual C++ for any reason.  In fact, we're so confident you'll love it, we'll offer
you an unconditional 60-day money-back guarantee!** But order now, while you've got everything in
front of you, because the line to the future is queuing up....


Enjoy!
