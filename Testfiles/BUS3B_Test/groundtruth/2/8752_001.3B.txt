Microsoft~


Dear Microsoft Customer,


I've wanted to write a real application in C++ for a long time.  For a couple of years, I've known that C++
and object oriented programming are the way to go, and that my designs, productivity, and code reusability
could all improve dramatically.  Everybody at Microsoft kept telling me that C++ was outstanding, but, to
tell you the truth, the transition seemed too hard.  The learning curve seemed too long and the payoff too far
in the future.  I like more immediate gratification.  Also, there haven't been any compelling objects
available for my reuse, so I've held off on my personal use of C++.

But recently I created my first C++ application for WindowsTM.  It does some number crunching and chart-
ing, and you'd be impressed with its level of functionality:  it's an MDI app, with a toolbar, status help, a
standard Windows-style menu interface, printing and Print Preview, scroll bars, splitter-views, great
support for standard File Open, Save and Save As, and a really handy Visual BasicTM custom control (a
spreadsheet-like grid).  I was able to reuse a bunch of my old C code and, most important, this application
screams with the lightning performance I demand.

I created my application in less than an hour using the Microsoft~ Visual C++TM development system!

So let me tell you about Visual C++, the successor to Microsoft C/C++ 7.0.  It's going to significantly
change the way applications for Windows are created in C++.  Visual C++ combines the power of reusable,
prebuilt code with an incredibly well-designed, totally integrated, visual development environment.  Visual
C++ includes the Microsoft Foundation Class Library version 2.0, a breathtaking design achievement
that captures the best Windows development expertise we have to offer at Microsoft, and puts it right at
your fingertips. Innovative wizards, serving as your programming assistants, help you leverage the power
of the Microsoft Foundation Classes.

And because you are a registered user of Microsoft C/C++ 7.0, you qualify for this special upgrade offer:

Visual C++, Professional Edition, for only $139*-~less than one-third of the suggested retail price of
$499.

You wanted a tightly integrated, easy-to-use, Windows-hosted development environment, and we
went overboard on your request.  Visual C++, with its elegant, streamlined integration, is our
response!

We are especially proud of four, very cool innovations in Visual C++:

Cool Innovation #1:  Visual Workbench.  The cornerstone of Visual C++, Visual Workbench provides an
unparalleled integrated toolset.  Seamlessly edit and browse while you debug or build your application (in
the background, if you want!).  Or run our Windows-hosted debugger directly in your edit window and set
breakpoints with a simple click of a mouse even while your application is not running!

Cool Innovation #2:  AppWizard.  It's never been so easy to get started developing in C++!  Use
AppWizard to customize the Microsoft Foundation Classes for your own needs.  Simply click on a list of
options and, within seconds, AppWizard will create a ready-to-build Windows-based application with
features such as an MDI, toolbar, Print Preview, OLE, and context-sensitive Help.
