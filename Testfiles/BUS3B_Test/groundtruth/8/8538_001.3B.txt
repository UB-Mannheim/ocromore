Referees
ICDAR'93


Dear Contributors


I am very pleased in reporting you that ICDAR'93 has gotten great success. Without your
service and devotion, we could not have had such a success.

ICDAR'93 was held on October 20-22, 1993 at Tsukuba Japan. There were 416 attendees
from 22 countries. About 40% of attendees were from abroad, so truly international forum was
constructed.

The quality of presented papers was very good and the discussion was exciting. Not only the oral
sessions, but also poster session was very crowded by audience, full of questions/answers and
discussion. Demonstration session, where 23 teams demonstrated their achievement using IBM-
PC, Sun workstations or their own machines, showed the real performance of their algorithms
and gave many suggestions for both presenters and audience.

Beside the technical sessions, social events were also fruitful. The technical tour to laboratories
in Tsukuba area attracted more than 100 participants. Banquet was also memorable.

On behalf of the Program Committee, I want to thank all who served as referees to construct
this splendid program. Your names are printed on one of the front pages in Proceedings, which
can be available at IEEE Computer Society Press.

I want to meet you at ICDAR'95 which will be held in Montreal, Canada, on August 14-16,
1995 and also at ICDAR'97 in Ulm, Germany.


Sincerely,


Yasuaki Nakano
Program Co-Chair
