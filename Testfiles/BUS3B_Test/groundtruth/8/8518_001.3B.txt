Dear Mr. Rice:


I want to commend you and the other residents of Red Rock and Chelsea Place for your concern
and commitment to your neighborhood. It is always gratifying to me to see the community pull
together and fight for what they believe in.

I would also like to take this opportunity to personally thank you for supporting me during the
many meetings that were held on the issue.

Rest assured that as your Councilman, I will continue to work hard toward ensuring that the
needs of my constituents are met.


Sincerely,


FRANK HAWKINS JR.
