Dear George:


This is just a note to update you on the status of the Department's
proposed statewide needs assessment.

The proposal has been in the federal Vocational Rehabilitation office for
some time. Unfortunately, it is taking much more time to process and
receive the approval than I had anticipated.

We continue to be very committed to conducting the needs assessment. I
hope next time we talk I will have good news.


Sincerely,


Timothy A. Andriano, Ph.D.
Planning Administrator
