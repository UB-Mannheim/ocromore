Dear sirs


I recently read your article published in INFORM, and was very interested in your studies.
I belong, as project manager, to a Department of EDF (French Electricity Board) Research
Center, which has in charge documentation problems for our company.

I have been myself dealing with document analysis and recognition for several years, and
we have developed a document recognition prototype on a SUN workstation.  This prototype
is based on our own binarization and segmentation modules, and uses several OCR toolkits
of the market, particularly those of XIS and CAERE.

The job we have to do this year is the evaluation and qualification of our prototype and
OCR results.  So, I would be very interested to read your reports, quoted at the end of your
paper.
Could I also have your e-mail addresses, and the address of ExperVision Inc., that I didn't
know till now ?


Thanks for your answer. Best regards.


                        Ph LEFEVRE
