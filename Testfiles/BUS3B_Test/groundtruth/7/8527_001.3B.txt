Dear Mr. Rice:


Enclosed is a copy of the paper "Shape Matching Using LAT and Its Application to Handwritten Numeral
Recognition", (Ref. # 92-09-14) by Toru Wakahara, which has been submitted for possible publication in the IEEE
Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. Because of your expertise in this area, I kindly request
that you act as a referee for this paper. If you can serve in this capacity, I would appreciate receiving your review
within six weeks. If you cannot referee the paper within this time, please return the manuscript to me as soon as
possible. In that case, it would be helpful if you could suggest one or more alternative referees.

The quality of IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence and the respectability of the field as a
whole are largely functions of the quality of reviewing. I thank you in advance for your consideration of this paper
