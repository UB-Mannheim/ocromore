thing we do ask is that you return your completed gift list
promptly - - today is best.


Happy Holidays,

P.S.  This is a one-time only offer.  Please R.S.V.P.

P.P.S.  It might seem a bit early to be thinking about the
holidays - - but at savings of more than 60% it pays to think
ahead and order now - - before the holiday rush starts!
