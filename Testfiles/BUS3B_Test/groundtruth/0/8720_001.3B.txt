Dear Mr. Rice:


If you're thinking about including document imaging as part of your IS strategy,
you've probably already discovered how every step in the document imaging process -
from data entry, to organization, to retrieval - can present bottlenecks and hidden
costs that may jeopardize the potential success of your system.

Now, PixTex/EFS, from Excalibur Technologies, offers you a simple and powerful
software solution for these complex document imaging problems by providing:

	~ commercial, off-the-shelf document imaging
	~ pattern recognition-based retrieval
	~ automatic indexing
	~ client/server architecture
	~ multiple platform operation.

PixTex/EFS uses Excalibur's exclusive Adaptive Pattern Recognition Processing
(APRP) which makes data clean-up and preprocessing unnecessary.  EFS is OCR-fault
tolerant, so you don't need costly clerical support for OCR cleanup.  And our
newest release, PixTex/EFS 3.0, includes OCR-zoning, launch and land, and a
thesaurus option for even more speed and flexibility.

Also, PixTex/EFS is fast to learn and easy to use.  Our graphical user interface
models an actual physical filing scenario; anyone who has used a filing cabinet can
easily understand how to operate this EFS system.

Let us show you how PixTex/EFS offers advantages for document capture, storage and
retrieval that no other document imaging software can match.  You can find us at:
