Dear Mr. Grover:


If you've been looking for a reporting tool that allows users to create great
looking reports quickly, as well as providing the control and industrial strength
features that an IS professional demands...look no further!

The ASK Group is pleased to announce ReportSmith, a new addition to our suite
of end-user productivity tools. ReportSmith is a client/server query and
reporting tool that will change the way you think about generating reports.

Here are just some of the ways that ReportSmith addresses your reporting needs:

 ~ Users will be instantly productive with ReportSmith's WYSIWYG
   interface based on Microsoft standards; there's no lengthy learning
   curve.

 ~ Reports are created with "live data" not mock-up data such as X's
   and 9's as with other report writers, and, there's no switching
   back and forth from report layout mode to report print mode.

 ~ Extensive cross-tab support includes multi-levels and multi-values,
   direct generation of charts from cross tabs, created by a simple
   point and click.

 ~ Embedded Visual Basic compatible macro language allows for complete
   extensibility.

 ~ Security controls allow you to define what your users have access
   to, as well as a Report Variable feature that lets you create
   generic reports that prompts user through selection criteria for
   a customized report.

 ~ SQL can be viewed and edited by users that prefer to have that
   flexibility.
