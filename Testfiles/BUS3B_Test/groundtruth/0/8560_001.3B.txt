Dear ANGELA MOLNAR:


We are pleased to inform you that your request for a BankAmericard

We think you will find your BankAmericard credit card to be a 
valuable financial tool:

     *  It gives you purchasing power worldwide for a variety of goods
        and services.

     *  You have the security of shopping or traveling without the need
        to carry a large amount of cash.

     *  Your BankAmericad credit card gives you access to cash advances
        at all Bank of America branches, as well as most other
        financial institutions.

You will receive monthly statements for your BankAmericard account
once you start using your card.  Your statements will show the
minimum payment due each month, as well as the payment due date.  Be
sure to make your payments on time to avoid late charges and
maintain a good credit rating.

Your statement will also list the Customer Service phone number to
call if you have any questions about your account.  Our automated
