Dear Security Director,


	I am a retired Long Beach Police Sergeant who has spent 21 years with the
police department and working in the private security sector. For the past 5 years,
I have owned and operated my own company, Frank A. Barcott Security and
Investigations.

	I specializes in hiring only off -duty and retired police officers, we offer you
security at its best. I believe we can be of great assistance to you. We have
over 1400 off-duty or retired police officers working for us that can assist you
anywhere in the State of California.
