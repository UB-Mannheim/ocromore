Dear Ken,


Just a quick note to thank you for getting the fall pharmacy research
completed so quickly.  I recognize the tight schedule you had to work
with and you turned it around in record time despite the changes we
made to the questionnaire.  As a result, we will be able to proceed
with commercial production right on schedule.

Thanks again.


Sincerely,


Melina Balboni
