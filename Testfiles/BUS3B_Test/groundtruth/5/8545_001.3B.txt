Dear Kanai:


Thank you for your contribution as a technical reviewer in
the Advanced Technology Program's (ATP) fourth competition
which has just ended. I have enclosed a copy of the
announcement describing the proposals selected for awards.
We think the potential benefit to the U.S. from these
projects is significant.

If you have any questions about this competition, call the
ATP office at (301) 975-5187.


Sincerely,


George A. Uriano
Director
Advanced Technology Program
