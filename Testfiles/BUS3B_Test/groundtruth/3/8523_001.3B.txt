Dear INGRES World Attendee,


The final details for INGRES World '93 are coming together and this year's conference will certainly
be one of the most informative and exciting ever. As you scan through the enclosed Agenda and
Solutions Centre listing, please notice the emphasis on client/server technology, distributed
computing techniques, and improving productivity with 4GLs and GUIs. That focus is a result of
your requests and Ingres' ongoing corporate commitment to open systems technology. We think this
twelfth annual INGRES World Conference is particularly suited to provide the answers that keep
your INGRES-based systems viable throughout the '90s.

Choose from more than 100 Technical and Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions.
Review hardware and software options from INGRES Partners.

As you'll see from the enclosed agenda, the scheduled Technical Sessions offer you a broad range of
practical strategies to maintain the power and flexibility of your information management systems.
Complementing those strategies are the hardware and software products exhibited by Ingres Partners
at the Solutions Centre. Enclosed, you'll find the lastest list of exhibitors. There may be last minute
additions to both the Technical Sessions and the Solutions Centre. You should plan to attend the
opening Conference Briefing, Sunday, May 9, between 5 and 6 pm, where you'll get a quick overview
of INGRES World '93 events including any schedule changes and amendments. Birds-of-a-Feather
Sessions will also be added throughout the conference in response to demand.

Enjoy beautiful San Francisco by night. Sign up for Tuesday's optional tour.
